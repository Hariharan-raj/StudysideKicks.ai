<h1>Inspiration</h1>
For many learners, the absence of a personal mentor and personalized learning can be a significant obstacle to achieving their goals. Without a mentor, learners may struggle to stay motivated, lack direction and feedback, and may not have access to the support and resources needed to succeed. Similarly, without personalized learning, learners may find themselves struggling to engage with generic materials that do not cater to their individual learning styles, making it difficult to retain information and apply it effectively. These problems can hinder progress and lead to frustration and ultimately, a lack of interest in learning.
